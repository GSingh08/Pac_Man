Project Description
Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality

Priority Matrix
Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the Time and Importance Matix.

      1. I created my array of different pieces of the game like the wall, the dots, and pacman
      2. I found pacman's position on the board
      3. I created my pacman game board
      4. Got pacman moving using the arrow keys
      5. have him detect walls and dots
      

MVP
Include the full list of features that will be part of your MVP
    
      1. Get Pacman on screen
      2. Also get the entire board on screen.

POST MVP
Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP

  Post MVP my game is fully funtional, Pacman is on the board and is eating the dots.  As he is traveling the board he is detecting if there are walls around him.  If there are walls around him, he will not go into that direction.  Also, Every dot Pacman eats, the score goes up by 1 point.  Once all the dots are eaten the user wins the game and then has the option of restarting. 

Wireframes
Include images of your wireframes.

Game Components
Landing Page

  My landing page will be ver minimialistic.  It will only have a start button that the user can click to go to the game page.

Game Initialization
What will a player see when the game is started?

  Once the player clicks the start button it will take them to the game.  In the game page the user will see pacman in a board surrounded by dots and walls.  his job is to go around collecting all the dots.  There will be a play again button to reset and a score counter on the top right of the page.

Playing The Game
What will be the flow of the game, what will the user be expected to do and what will the user expect from the game.

The user will be expected to use the arrow keys and move around the game to collect all the dots and increase their score.

Winning The Game
What does it look like when the game ends, what determines winning or losing?

Once the dots are collected, an alert will pop up showing the user they have won.  

Game Reset
How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.

There will be a "Play Again?" button at the bottom of the screen for the user to click if they want to play again.

Functional Components
Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility. Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.

Component	Priority	Estimated Time	Time Invetsted	Actual Time
Component 1	H	10hrs	12hrs	12hrs
Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

Function	Description
Capitalize	This will capitalize the first letter in a string
Additional Libraries
Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project.

jQuery Discoveries
Use this section to list some, but not all, of the jQuery methods and\or functionality discovered while working on this project.

Change Log
Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.

Issues and Resolutions
Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

Most of the problems I encountered were because of scope and where I was calling my function.  This project has helped me understand scope and calling my functions more than I did before.  Also, Getting pacman to move was very difficult as well as detecting if there is a wall infront of pacman.  What helped me resolve was to break down everything into very small pieces and get that small piece to work. 

SAMPLE.....
ERROR: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
RESOLUTION: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
